# NFL Dashboard

This repository contains the code, data, and configuration files needed to launch a Streamlit dashboard that breaks down matchups in the NFL. This dashboard is designed to visualize important factors when looking into game matchups, including:
* Weather information
* Spreads and totals
* Team records
* PFF Grades
* Injuries
* And more!

This dashboard is designed to be used as a tool for myself - whether it be for betting, fantasy, or recreation. Anyone may feel free to use this dashboard as they please!
